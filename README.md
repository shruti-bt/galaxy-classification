# DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys galaxy classification

This project aim to classify the galaxy images collected using DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys using convolutional neural network. We used a ResNet-50 pretrained model which was trained on ImageNet dataset. The model is finetune for 50 epochs and achived 85% accuracy on test dataset.
